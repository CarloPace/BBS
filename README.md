# BBS
Bulletin Board System, with secure connection and message exchanging.
The secure connection is established using a custom protocol wich make use of RSA signatures with PSS padding scheme, and DHKE to establish a shared secret. Using a key Derivation Function based on HMAC, 2 keys are derived, one is used as Encryption Key for Authenticated Encryption, the other key called Nonce Key is used to generate the IVs used for the authenticated encryption. A mechanism to prevent replay attacks is implemented, the IV used in the auhtenticated encryption are Nonces generated using an HMAC algorithm, in which the input are Communications Sequence Numbers and the used Key is the Nonce Key.
All the data are stored in a Redis database, the communications beetween the Server and the database exploit the hiredis library.
